Multipath QUIC (MPQUIC), an emerging multipath transport protocol (MTP) that inherits the advantages of the canonical multipath TCP (MPTCP) and the widespread QUIC, potentially plays a vital role in 5G and beyond. MPQUIC can exploit multiple networks (e.g., Wi-Fi, LTE, 5G) on a mobile device to boost the quality of services while efficiently utilizing network resources. In MPQUIC, the scheduler, which is in charge of concurrently scheduling data transmission in several paths, largely impacts the protocolsâ€™ performance, especially in dynamic environments. In fact, in the literature, a considerable number of MTP schedulers for MPQUIC have been proposed. Unfortunately, their performances have been primarily evaluated in static networks without (or simply) considering mobile ones. Hence, this work attempts to investigate the performance of MPQUIC schedulers in the mobile context, aiming to fill the literature gap. Specifically, we implement and assess the performance of five MPQUIC
